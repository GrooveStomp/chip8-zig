- BLINKY doesn't seem to work at all

- SYZYGY appears bugged
  It appears to work normally for a while, then just freezes.
  The left boundary wall doesn't render

- VERS doesn't draw all the edges of the screen properly?

- Sound doesn't appear to play for long enough.
  It should be playing until the sound timer reaches zero.
